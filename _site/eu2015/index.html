Learn how to architect large, complex, and native-like PhoneGap apps using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We will investigate 
mobile challenges and find solutions for them as well as learn about Single Page Architecture, HTML templates, performance 
techniques, frameworks and more. We will also build a full-fledge working app you can take home for reference after the 
Workshop.</li>

    <li><b>God Mode</b><br>
        <!--<i>Workshops led by Holly Schinsky</i><br>-->
This workshop will give an intro to PhoneGap Enterprise and AEM Apps. You will create a PGE app, build and install an AEM package, author some new content for your app and finally build the final app via the command line and the PGE app. Bonus! You'll also learn how to instrument an app for tracking with mobile services.</li>

        <b>08:30 ... Registration</b><br/>
        <b>09:00 ... Michael Brooks / PhoneGap 2014 Review</b>
        <!--oh man yohei would hate me for doing these inline styles! :)  hi yohei!! -->
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">Come take a walk with me down memory lane. We'll admire the new members of the PhoneGap family. Breath in the fresh air of improvement. Stroll by the countless bug fixes. And end our journey with an acknowledge to everyone who helped bring PhoneGap into 2015.</span><br/>
        <b>09:40 ... Syd Lawrence / Making High Performance PhoneGap Apps</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">How we made people think that Snowbuddy was a native app</span><br/>
        <b>10:20 ... Break</b><br>
        <b>10:50 ... Martin Kool / Achievement Unlocked</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">You've just added Achievements and Leaderboards to your HTML5 game for iOS and Android</span><br/>
        <b>11:30 ... Crosswalk: Unleash the fury of web innovation in your Android app today</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">Web technologies are improving at a rapid pace. New features such as responsive design, cloud services, WebRTC, WebGL and Canvas provide developers with a great deal of potential. However, leveraging these features in a fragmented Android market is difficult, and oft-times impossible given the diversity of the various platform versions and capabilities. This session introduces the Crosswalk Project, an open-source, Chromium-based, HTML5 runtime that opens up the full set of leading-edge web innovations to Android developers and greatly reduces the fragmentation limitations. The Crosswalk Project is already available as a Cordova plugin so build and deploy steps are right at your fingertips.</span><br/>
        <b>11:50 ... Denis Radin / HTML GL - Render HTML & CSS via WebGL For 60 fps and a bit of effects</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">HTML GL solves "the slow DOM problem" by creating WebGL representations of DOM elements and hiding actual DOM after. This speeds up HTML/CSS animations and transformations by using 3D hardware acceleration and allows to apply OpenGL effects as modern 3D games have. Also will shed some light on approaches being developed in UPC for getting highest performance on mobile and TV devices.</span><br/>
        <b>12:10 ... Lunch</b><br>
        <b>01:10 ... Max and Ben / Reframing Hybrid</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">Historically, discussion around hybrid app development has focused on performance and native look and feel. While those are incredibly important topics, we'd like to reframe the conversation and focus on the ways in which hybrid development gives developers advantages over native development. We'll talk about how Ionic, PhoneGap, and other hybrid technologies give app developers abilities they never had before, resulting in apps that are faster and cheaper to build, more dynamic, and more successful.</span><br/>
        <b>01:50 ... Niels Leenheer / The Android Webview</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">The Android WebView is a system level component that handles HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and can be used by other applications. One of the applications that uses the WebView is the default Android browser, but your own PhoneGap apps are also using it. In fact, PhoneGap is just a wrapper that extends the WebView. Unfortunately there is not just one WebView. The WebView changes between versions of Android. Sometimes these changes are just bug fixes, and sometimes they include new features. What’s even worse: device manufactures apparently also like to make their own modifications to the WebView. Recently Google tried to solve this mess and created a new backwards compatible WebView for Android 4.4 and higher. The new WebView is no longer based on WebKit, but uses Chromium instead. What are the differences and how does this impact your applications? Is the new WebView really backwards compatible? Which web platform features should you avoid in your PhoneGap app and which are safe to use? How do you deal with creating apps for a multitude of WebViews that all behave slightly different? Which devices do you need to properly test your app? And finally, are there other solutions to these problems?</span><br/>
        <b>02:10 ... Anis Kadri / Embedding Natively</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">The Hybrid Sweet Spot" Many developers choose to build native navigation and transitions into their apps but use webviews for the main content, allowing them to realize a large cost and time savings while making their app available to a wider range of users quickly. This approach also provides the ability to push timely updates without app store approval hassles. With this model, only a small native code-base needs to be maintained per platform, and it’s typically the static elements of the app rather than the main content, thus more manageable.</span><br/>
        <b>02:30 ... Matt May / PhoneGap Accessibility</b><br/>
        <b>02:50 ... Sebastian Witalec / The Telerik Platform—Cordova Apps Made Easy</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">Building hybrid apps is hard. In addition to actually coding an application, you also have to deal platform-specific configuration files, icons, permissions, deployment procedures, and more. That's where Telerik comes in. With a series of tools—including cloud-based builds, dozens of high-quality (and free) Cordova plugins, and a whole lot more—Telerik provides everything you need to take the pain out of hybrid development.</span><br />
        <b>03:10 ... Break</b><br>
        <b>03:40 ... Claudio Cossio / Luck + Motion: User Growth for your App</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">In 1978 Dr. James Justin work a book called Chase, Chance & Creativity where he talks about the 4 types of "chance's" a researcher might find. This can be directly applied to any type of work that is based on creativity, it can be applied on how to find growth for your app. We will explain it with some cool use case's.</span><br/>
        <b>04:20 ... Rupinder Mann / Introducing the Ubuntu Phone</b><br/>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">Ubuntu phone overview - why it's the platform for developers.</span><br/>
        <b>04:40 ... Simon MacDonald / Push n' Pull</b>
        <span style="font-size:0.8em">Do you ever wish your users were more engaged with your app? Or that you could update its content more easily? Come learn about the new, easier to configure and use Push Plugin and how to deliver content and code updates using the all new, all different Content Sync plugin.</span><br/>
