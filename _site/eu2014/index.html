    <h2>// Workshops</h2>
    <p>Dive deeper into PhoneGap by attending our pre-conference workshops on Thursday, 25 September 2014. Choose between two different tracks:</p>

    <h3>PhoneGap, from beginner to God Mode</h3><br/>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Beginner: Intro to PhoneGap</b><br>
<!--        <i>Workshops led by Christophe Coenraets and Holly Schinsky</i><br>-->
This workshop will provide an introduction to PhoneGap, the philosophy behind it and how to get started quickly using a variety of different tools available. The CLI, PhoneGap Developer App, PhoneGap Build and more will be shown and you will learn about the many frameworks available to choose from when building your mobile apps. You will also be shown debugging techniques and walk away with a solid understanding of what PhoneGap is all about. Lastly you can expect to hear an introduction to the PhoneGap Enterprise offering Adobe has been working on.
</li>

    <li><b>Advanced: Architecting PhoneGap apps</b><br>
<!--        <i>Workshops led by Christophe Coenraets</i><br>-->
Learn how to architect large, complex, and native-like PhoneGap apps using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We will investigate mobile challenges and find solutions for them as well as learn all about Single Page Architecture, HTML templates, effective touch events, performance techniques, MVC Frameworks and more. In this session you will also learn more about PhoneGap Enterprise and see how page editing and content update works.
    </li>

    <li><b>God Mode: Building an app from scratch and more...</b><br>
<!--        <i>Workshops led by Holly Schinsky</i><br>-->
In this session we’ll build a full-blown mobile application from scratch for a real world scenario using PhoneGap and a popular UI framework stack. You will learn how to implement various plugins and all about the plugin architecture in general so you can go build your own custom plugins in the future. We’ll use the tools introduced in the first session and knowledge gleaned throughout the day to help solidify the concepts. You’ll also delve more into the PhoneGap Enterprise offering and see a demo using a specific app that will show off some of the new features available.
    </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>PhoneGap Ecosystem: workshops from Mozilla</h3><br/>
    <ul>
        <li><b>PhoneGap – Firefox OS App Workshop 95 Minutes - with Rodrigo Silveira, Jason Weathersby & Piotr Zalewa</b>
            <br />
Firefox OS is an open source operating system for mobile built using HTML5, Javascript and open web standards. Firefox OS integration with Apache Cordova / Adobe PhoneGap began early this year, and development is ongoing. As Firefox OS continues to expand to new markets around the world, there's a great opportunity for multi-platform app developers like you.  If you are interested in porting an application built with Cordova to Firefox OS, this workshop will get you up and running.  
<br /><br />
We'll begin with the current status of the Firefox OS Cordova integration, including demos of building and debugging basic Cordova Apps using Firefox’s new Web IDE. The rest of the workshop will be hands-on: we'll help you run your app on a Firefox OS device.  Some of the topics that we'll cover:
<br /><br />
1 - Installing and setting up Firefox OS with Cordova<br/>
2 - Demos of Cordova plugins that support Firefox OS<br/>
3 - Connecting a Firefox OS phone and pushing your app to a live device<br/>
4 - Overview of all available developer tools<br/>
5 - Editing and live debugging your Firefox App with the App Manager and WebIDE<br/>
6 - Experimenting with the PhoneGap Developer App<br/>
<br/><br/>
This Workshop will also provide hands-on access to Firefox OS devices, so you can test and debug your apps and get a feel for the experience.<br/><br/>  
Developers who successfully port their apps during the Workshop or shortly thereafter will be eligible to receive their own Firefox OS Flame reference device. Stay tuned for details.</li>
        <li>More workships to be announced soon!</li>
